LaTeXTools Plugin version 2012-09-24-night (!) changelog:

New features:

- Added initial support for settings. The default settings file is

	LaTeXTools Preferences.sublime-settings

  which you can find in the plugin's directory. However, if you want to customize, DO NOT
  change that file: rather, copy it into the User directory, and modify that copy. This way
  your customizations will be preserved when you update LaTeXTools.

- Whether the focus stays on ST2 or switches to the PDF viewer can be determined using the
  setting "keep_focus": true for ST2, false for PDF

- Various settings to adapt forward/backward search to different Linux distros: see the
  settings file for details.
